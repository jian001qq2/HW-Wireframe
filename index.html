### Instructions
   * If this process was done correctly, you should see these two files appear in your repository. This will be your initial test to confirm that you're hooked into GitHub.
5. Return to your local copies of `index.html` and `style.css`. Using the screenshot at the top of these instructions, recreate the design using HTML/CSS.
   * All of your HTML should be inside of the `index.html` file.
   * All of your CSS should be inside of the `style.css` file.
6. When you finish the assignment, commit your changes with Git and push them into your GitHub repo. Remember:
   * `git add .`
   * `git commit -m "<COMMENT>"`
   * `git push origin master`

* Don't forget to review these concepts: `float`, `padding`, `margin`, `display`, `overflow`, `clear` and `text-align`.
* This will be a tough assignment. But 23 weeks from now, you'll look back to this exercise and realize just how much you've grown as a developer. Stay positive!
